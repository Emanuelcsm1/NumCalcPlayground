# Numerical Methods in Octave

This repository contains a collection of scripts developed during coursework on Numerical Analysis. The codes are written in Octave and include implementations of various numerical methods for solving mathematical problems.

## Contents

The repository includes:
- **Root-Finding Methods**: Bisection, Newton-Raphson, and Secant methods.
- **Linear Systems**: Gaussian elimination, LU decomposition, and iterative solvers.
- **Numerical Integration**: Trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule, and Gaussian quadrature.
- **Interpolation**: Polynomial interpolation using Lagrange and Newton's methods.
- **Optimization**: Gradient descent and related techniques.
- **Differential Equations**: Runge-Kutta methods for solving ODEs.

## Usage

All scripts are written in Octave, an open-source alternative to MATLAB. To run any script:
1. Ensure Octave is installed: [https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/).
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```
3. Open the script of interest in Octave and execute it.

## About

These scripts were created as part of academic projects to explore and apply numerical methods to practical problems in engineering and mathematics.
